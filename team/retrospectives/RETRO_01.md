## General Notes

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro
doing alright, haven't accomplished much yet
our goal is currently to figure out a tech stack, but we have that down
probably need to check out frameworks more but we have enough time
Jason figured out src hierarchy
finish basic web app interface today probably
Issue: Hirish couldnt start authentication on CSIL
basic starting point, following the videos

possible backend goals: a timer and google API
possible frontend goals: a basic textbox, and a title, sign in as well(update: we finished the Google authentification)

virtual keyboard? as a luxury idea
