# Retro #2 10/29/21 

* Led by: Jeffrey
* Present: Jeffrey, Sean, Zoey, Jason 
* Absent: Hirish

## Action item

* a goal: We want to accelerate our work and get features out faster
* a change: Work on easier features like the UI and pages first, add information to the profile pages on what they have done so far, make the timer cleaner
* a measurement: We want these working features accomplished by Friday next week (must have new page that redirects to other languages, must have relevant information in profile to user, must have timer that isn't intrusive) 

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro
