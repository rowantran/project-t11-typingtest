Goals
=========
We will create a typing tutor/trainer for programmers based on open source code, allow you to practice typing the key sequences that appear in real code in different languages. Typing read code can help with the speed and accracy of coding as well as remembering the syntax. Faster and more accurate typing not only does this speed up development, it fundamentally affects the exploration process.

Series of events
=========
1. Develop our user stories and decide our goal for the web app
2. Decide which platform for front and backend tha we will use for the web app
3. Making of rough design for project
4. Plan our MVP
5. Decide the role and respoinsibility(e.g. Frontend or Backend) for the MVP: a web allows people to type in a certain programming language
6. Test our MVP
7. Continuely add new features to the MVP
