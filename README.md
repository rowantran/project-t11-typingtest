# project-t11-typingtest

It's a webapp that helps improve coding speed and gauge coding level.

Members: Jeffrey Chen, Jason Dunne, Sean Shanley, Zoey Zhou, Hirish Chandrasekaran

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React
We do not think we need a serious backend. Most of this is client-side code.


General Strategy: Get our template up, look at preexisting react projects, modify accordingly. There is nothing wrong with modifying previously implemented code, it will give us more time to add more features down the line.


User Roles:
General User Trying to Learn How to Code, and remember syntax. Doesn't need permission to any data except his/her own. Can log in through his/her ucsb account and save progress. Our app provides typing practice for difficult lines of code and helps with syntax memorization and also explains what code blocks do so helps with pattern recognition.
